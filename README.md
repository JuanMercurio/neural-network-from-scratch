##  What is this repo
This is a repo in which I try to understand neural networks and build it from scratch on C. 

## Current Version
The master branch contains a version of the code that predicts the XOR function

## ToDo
- [x] Option to choose between activation functions on each layer (mnst branch)
- [ ] Accept user created functions
- [x] Options to choose Cost function (mnst branch)
- [ ] Accept user created functions
- [ ] Matrix load/save 
- [x] Read csv (minst database)
- [ ] Analyze stochastic gd and batch

## Exquisite ToDo
- [ ] Cache improvement
  - [ ] Continuos memory matrix
  - [ ] Continuos memory list

- [ ] Multiple threads improvement
  - [ ] Matrix operations using threads
